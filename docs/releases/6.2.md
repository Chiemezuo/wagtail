## What's new

### New Image Block

Wagtail now provides an accessibility-first alternative to the existing `ImageChooserBlock` called `ImageBlock`. This new block provides the ability to set alt text that is meaningful to the particular context where the image is used, rather than as a general-purpose description of the image, right out of the box.

`ImageBlock` is backwards-compatible and will perfectly replace `ImageChooserBlock` wherever the latter appears, without any complex block data migrations. This new block has a mandatory alt text field, and is now the Wagtail-recommended approach to images, as will be seen by updated documentation examples.

This feature was developed by Chiemezuo Akujobi as a Google Summer of Code project, mentored by Storm Heg and Saptak Sengupta.

### Other features

 * Optimize and consolidate redirects report view into the index view (Jake Howard, Dan Braghis)

 * Refactor redirects edit view to use the generic `EditView` and breadcrumbs (Rohit Sharma)
 * Allow custom permission policies on snippets to prevent superusers from creating or editing them (Sage Abdullah)
 * Do not link to edit view from listing views if user has no permission to edit (Sage Abdullah)
 * Allow access to snippets and other model viewsets to users with "View" permission (Sage Abdullah)
 * Skip `ChooseParentView` if only one possible valid parent page availale (Matthias Brück)

 * Update deployment instructions for Fly.io (Jeroen de Vries)

### Maintenance

 * Use `DjangoJSONEncoder` instead of custom `LazyStringEncoder` to serialize Draftail config (Sage Abdullah)

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting all projects

### Specifying a dict of distribution IDs for CloudFront cache invalidation is deprecated

Previous versions allowed passing a dict for `DISTRIBUTION_ID` within the `WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE` configuration for a CloudFront backend, to allow specifying different distribution IDs for different hostnames. This is now deprecated; instead, multiple distribution IDs should be defined as [multiple backends](frontendcache_multiple_backends), with a `HOSTNAMES` parameter to define the hostnames associated with each one. For example, a configuration such as:

```python
WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE = {
    'cloudfront': {
        'BACKEND': 'wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache.backends.CloudfrontBackend',
        'DISTRIBUTION_ID': {
            'www.wagtail.org': 'your-distribution-id',
            'www.madewithwagtail.org': 'other-distribution-id',
        },
    },
}
```

should now be rewritten as:

```python
WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE = {
    'mainsite': {
        'BACKEND': 'wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache.backends.CloudfrontBackend',
        'DISTRIBUTION_ID': 'your-distribution-id',
        'HOSTNAMES': ['www.wagtail.org'],
    },
    'madewithwagtail': {
        'BACKEND': 'wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache.backends.CloudfrontBackend',
        'DISTRIBUTION_ID': 'other-distribution-id',
        'HOSTNAMES': ['www.madewithwagtail.org'],
    },
}
```


## Upgrade considerations - deprecation of old functionality

## Upgrade considerations - changes affecting Wagtail customisations

### Replacing ImageChooserBlock with ImageBlock

If you created any block with `ImageChooserBlock` in it, you can replace it with `ImageBlock` as is, and run `./manage.py makemigrations`.
>**Note**: For use-cases where alt text is not applicable (such as in specifying a background image), you should leave the `ImageChooserBlock`.

#### Old syntax

```python
from wagtail.images.blocks import ImageChooserBlock

class ImageBlock(StructBlock):
    image = ImageChooserBlock(required=True)
    caption = CharBlock(required=False)
    attribution = CharBlock(required=False)
```

#### New syntax

```python
from wagtail.images.blocks import ImageBlock

class ImageBlock(StructBlock):
    image = ImageBlock(required=True)
    caption = CharBlock(required=False)
    attribution = CharBlock(required=False)
```

If you had previously created custom image blocks specifically for adding alt text support, you can leave them as they are. Wagtail will not be deprecating the `ImageChooserBlock`. However, if you want to switch to the out-of-the-box `ImageBlock`, you can switch to it if you used `alt_text` as the name of your alt text field. If it's not the name, you can do a [`StreamField` migration](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/v4.2/advanced_topics/streamfield_migrations.html) to rename the field to `alt_text`, and then switch.

## Upgrade considerations - changes to undocumented internals

### Modification of default alt text behaviour

Wagtail will no longer default to using titles as alt text in the absence of any alt text.
